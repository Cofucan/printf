# Printf Project

This is a team project where I worked with my ALX SE collegue, Eghieye Prosper, on a implementing a custom printf function in C. We are tasked with handling the following conversion specifiers:

* c: specifier to print a character
* s: specifier to print a string
* %: specifier to literally print the '%' sign
b: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary
Handle the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers
Handle the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
